The program follows a simple structure. The user interacts with a UI layer, and the application logic is handled chiefly 
by the markovManager class. Simulation descriptions are contained in simDescriptor objects, which can be loaded from a data access object or created by the user in the application.

The simulation itself is contained in the simulation class.
